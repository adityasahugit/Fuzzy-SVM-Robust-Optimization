# Fuzzy SVM

This flie is direct implementation of Fuzzy svm suggested by forghani.

Using Fuzzy SVM concept on imbalance dataset to optimize the predictions.

The used dataset are doubled such that we can try one vs rest validation.

FSVM IRIS.ipynb and FSVM glass.ipynb are the python programs to predict the amount of misclassification achieved after apllying Fuzzy concept.
